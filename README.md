# Helmet__and_license_plate_detection_project
Developed a computer vision-based system to automatically detect helmet usage and recognize vehicle license plates from real-time images or video feeds. Implemented image preprocessing and object detection using OpenCV to identify motorcyclists and classify helmet presence. Integrated Tesseract OCR to extract alphanumeric data from license plates.
